# Data Pipeline Testing Plan
## Core Testing Areas for Data Components
### 1. Data Ingestion Testing

- Format validation: Test that input data meets expected formats
- Schema validation: Verify data conforms to expected schema
- Volume handling: Ensure the component handles varying data volumes
- Error handling: Test behavior with malformed or missing data

### 2. Data Processing/Transformation Testing

- Transformation accuracy: Verify transformations produce expected outputs
- Edge cases: Test with boundary values and special cases
- Performance: Evaluate processing time with different data volumes
- State management: Test stateful operations maintain consistency

### 3. Data Output Testing

- Format correctness: Verify output data format meets specifications
- Completeness: Ensure all expected data is present in output
- Consistency: Check that repeated runs with same input produce same output

### Testing Methodologies

- Unit tests: Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Integration tests: Test interactions between components
- End-to-end tests: Validate complete data flows through the pipeline
- Performance tests: Measure throughput, latency, and resource usage
- Data quality tests: Validate business rules and data quality expectations
