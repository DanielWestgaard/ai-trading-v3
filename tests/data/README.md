# Data Pipeline Testing Plan
## Core Testing Areas for Data Components
### 1. Data Ingestion Testing

- Format validation: Test that input data meets expected formats
- Schema validation: Verify data conforms to expected schema
- Volume handling: Ensure the component handles varying data volumes
- Error handling: Test behavior with malformed or missing data

### 2. Data Processing/Transformation Testing

- Transformation accuracy: Verify transformations produce expected outputs
- Edge cases: Test with boundary values and special cases
- Performance: Evaluate processing time with different data volumes
- State management: Test stateful operations maintain consistency

### 3. Data Output Testing

- Format correctness: Verify output data format meets specifications
- Completeness: Ensure all expected data is present in output
- Consistency: Check that repeated runs with same input produce same output

### Testing Methodologies

- Unit tests: Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Integration tests: Test interactions between components
- End-to-end tests: Validate complete data flows through the pipeline
- Performance tests: Measure throughput, latency, and resource usage
- Data quality tests: Validate business rules and data quality expectations

## Data Pipeline Testing: Your First Line of Defense
Your data pipeline deserves the most rigorous testing in your entire codebase. Here's why:

- Garbage In = Garbage Out: All models, strategies, and decisions depend on clean, accurate data. Testing data transformations is your foundation.
- Silent Failure Risk: Data bugs are often silent and won't throw exceptionsâ€”they just produce wrong results that propagate through your system.
- Financial Impact: In live trading, data errors directly translate to financial losses.

Time-Series Specific Pitfalls:
- Look-ahead bias (using future data)
- Survivorship bias
- Timeline alignment issues
- Timezone inconsistencies
