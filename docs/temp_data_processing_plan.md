Here's a comprehensive approach to processing financial time series data before model training:

## Data Processing Steps for Financial Model Training

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Handle missing values**: Fill gaps with forward/backward fill, interpolation, or remove incomplete days
- **Remove duplicates**: Check for and eliminate duplicate entries
- **Outlier detection**: Identify and handle extreme values using techniques like Z-score or IQR
- **Check for and handle data gaps**: Weekend gaps, market holidays, or trading halts

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Technical indicators**: Add RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages, etc.
- **Volatility measures**: Add historical volatility, ATR (Average True Range)
- **Price transformations**: Log returns, percentage changes, momentum
- **Time-based features**: Day of week, month, seasonality patterns, time to market events
- **Volume analysis**: Volume moving averages, OBV (On-Balance Volume)
- **External data integration**: Market sentiment, economic indicators, news events

### 3. Data Normalization and Scaling
- **Standardization**: Convert to z-scores (mean=0, std=1)
- **Min-Max scaling**: Normalize to range [0,1] or [-1,1]
- **Robust scaling**: Use median and IQR instead of mean/std for outlier resilience
- **Rolling window normalization**: Scale based on recent history for adaptive models

### 4. Time Series Specific Processing
- **Stationarity transformations**: Differencing, detrending
- **Lag features**: Create lagged versions of price/volume data
- **Return calculations**: Convert prices to returns (percentage or log)
- **Autocorrelation analysis**: Identify significant lags for feature selection
- **Sequence preparation**: Create input/output sequences for ML models (X/y splitting)

### 5. Data Splitting
- **Train/validation/test splits**: Chronological splits (not random shuffling)
- **Walk-forward validation**: Rolling window approach to simulate real trading
- **Purge gaps**: Ensure no data leakage between training and testing periods

### 6. Class Balancing (for classification tasks)
- **Oversampling**: SMOTE or other techniques for minority classes
- **Undersampling**: Reduce majority class samples
- **Adjusted thresholds**: Modify decision boundaries to account for imbalance
- **Custom loss functions**: Penalize mistakes on minority classes more heavily

### 7. Feature Selection
- **Correlation analysis**: Remove highly correlated features
- **Importance ranking**: Use techniques like mutual information, SHAP values
- **Dimensionality reduction**: PCA, t-SNE for condensing feature space
- **Domain knowledge filtering**: Select features based on financial expertise

### 8. Data Augmentation (if needed)
- **Noise addition**: Add small random variations to simulate market noise
- **Bootstrap sampling**: Create variations of training sequences
- **Synthetic minority sampling**: Generate synthetic examples for rare market conditions

Remember that feature engineering and selection are particularly important for financial data. The predictive power often comes from the right combination of indicators and transformations rather than just the raw price data.
